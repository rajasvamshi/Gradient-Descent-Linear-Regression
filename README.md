# Gradient Descent for Linear Regression

This project implements Linear Regression using:
- Closed-form solution (Normal Equation)
- Gradient Descent (η = 0.05, 1000 iterations)

## Outputs
- Raw dataset plot
- Closed-form fitted line
- Gradient Descent fitted line
- Loss curve (MSE vs iterations)

## Conclusion
Gradient Descent converges to nearly the same parameters as the closed-form solution.
